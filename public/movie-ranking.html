<h3>1. Love,Simon (2018)</h3>
<p>It's about a closeted gay teeenager named Simon Spier who falls in love with another guy from his school named anonymously 'Blue' over the Internet. And, it's interesting to see how his life changes after this is revealed to his freinds and parents.</p>
<h3>2. Leap Year (2010)</h3>
<p>It's a romantic movie set in Ireland. Most of the shooting has taken place in Ireland & the scenary shown in the movie is very beatiful. It has perfectly shown some picturesque locations in Ireland.</p>
<h3>3. Speak (2004)</h3>
<p>It's about a teeenager girl who was raped by a senior popular boy in her school. And, It's great to see how she deals with the feelings of loneliness & depression afterwards and also eventually teaches the same guy a lesson.</p>
